# WebChatRoom
This is the epitomy of what I have been attempting to achieve through these Web Development classes. My goal was to figure out a new portal to display my back-end code. I've successfully learned Python Flask, and can now use Vue.js. Although Vue.js is not displayed in this project, I would say that it was a true success. The main reason vue is not here is due to how it may conflict with Flask. They are fairly similar in concept, at least if running Vue.app, though Flask has a bit of functionality that Vue does not. 

Anyway, this is a web chat room for people to communicate with one another. 

# Dependencies
